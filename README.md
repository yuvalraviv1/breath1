# breath1

Create a JavaScript single HTML file. It reads iPhone's accelerometer data and displays it on the page. The final goal is to monitor breathing patterns by placing the phone on the stomach or the chest.

### Usage

Open `index.html` on your mobile device. On iOS (including Edge for iPhone), tap the page once to grant motion sensor access. Use the on‑screen controls to adjust the sample interval and the number of samples shown before fading. After tapping, the accelerometer values will appear on screen along with a 2D fading trail reflecting your chosen settings.
Use the axis selector to choose whether the trail plots X–Y, X–Z or Y–Z with the remaining axis mapped to color.
